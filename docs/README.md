# Project PerceptionAI

Welcome to the PerceptionAI project! This project aims to create a neural network from scratch using only the Numpy library in Python. The developed neural network will be capable of recognizing handwritten digits.

## Installation

To launch the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raphaelCamblong/PerceptionAI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PerceptionAI
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install project dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the project's source code.
- `data/`: May contain data necessary for training the network (if applicable).
- `docs/`: documentation about the project.
- `venv/`: Virtual environment directory (if created).

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project. Make sure the virtual environment is activated.
